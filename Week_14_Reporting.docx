Week 14: Project Reporting – Personal Finance Tracker

Task 2: Report

1. What hurdles have you faced so far?

Most of the hurdles I encountered were related to file handling, shell script errors, and GitHub integration. A few scripts did not behave as expected when files were missing or when run without proper permissions. I also initially struggled to push my code to GitHub due to changes in authentication methods (GitHub no longer accepts passwords for HTTPS push).

2. How did you solve them?

Below is a breakdown of each issue I faced and how I resolved it:

| Code File               | Issue Faced                                                                 | Solution Implemented                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| add_transaction.sh     | Script crashed because transactions.txt didn't exist                        | Used `touch transactions.txt` before testing                                          |
| delete_transaction.sh  | `sed -i` failed on macOS when deleting by ID                                | Replaced with `grep -v "^$id,"` and redirected to temp.txt, then renamed              |
| *.sh scripts           | Got “Permission denied” errors                                               | Used `chmod +x *.sh` to make all scripts executable                                   |
| Git push               | GitHub wouldn’t accept password for push                                    | Created a Personal Access Token (PAT) and used it instead of a password               |
| Zip upload             | Files weren’t visible on GitHub when zipped                                 | Unzipped locally and pushed individual source files to repo                           |
| view_transactions.sh   | Used `less` which didn’t format well in basic terminals                     | Switched to `cat` for cleaner, consistent output                                      |
| export.sh              | Overwrote previous CSV file silently                                        | Confirmed this is intended behavior and noted it in README                            |

3. What are your next steps?

- Finalize my `README.md` to clearly explain each script’s purpose and include examples.
- Run a final test using invalid inputs to make sure the scripts handle errors properly.
- Push all final files (scripts, .txt, .csv, README, and this report) to GitHub.
- Submit the GitHub link and zip file as my completed Week 14 deliverable.
